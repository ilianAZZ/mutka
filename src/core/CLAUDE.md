# src/core/ — Infrastructure Layer

This folder is the **skeleton of the app**. It has zero features.
Modules and components depend on it; it depends on nothing inside `src/` outside core.

Each subsystem lives in its own folder (`module-registry/`, `sandbox/`, `app-bridge/`,
`event-bus/`, `shortcut-manager/`, `input-manager/`, `file-watch/`, `theme-manager/`,
`tab-manager/`, `stores/`). `types.ts` holds the cross-cutting foundation types.

---

## How modules reach the system (read this first)

A module — built-in or community — is `export default defineModule({ id, name, version,
permissions, commands, openHandlers, setup })`. It imports NOTHING from core. In
`setup(host)` it receives a `host` object, which is the ONLY way it touches anything
privileged. Every `host.*` call is routed through the **permission gateway**.

```text
module.setup(host) → host.fs.readDir(p)
  → gateway.ts: does the module's manifest declare the required permission?
       no  → throws "Permission denied"
       yes → capabilities.ts runs it (the ONLY place that calls invoke / AppBridge / TabManager)
```

Two runtimes host modules, **same format, same gateway**:

- **`sandbox/LocalHost.ts`** — built-in/trusted modules, IN-PROCESS (direct calls).
- **`sandbox/SandboxHost.ts`** — community/untrusted modules, ISOLATED in a Web Worker
  (no DOM, no `invoke`, no core reference; reaches the system only via postMessage).

Switching a module between the two is a one-line change in `moduleLoader.ts`; the module
code is identical. For an author's guide, see `COMMUNITY_MODULES.md`.

## Files and their single responsibilities

### `types.ts` — Foundation Types

Cross-cutting types used by multiple subsystems: `FileItem`, `ClipboardState`,
`NavigationAPI`, `DialogAPI` (+ its option shapes), and `BaseContext` (the read-only view
of app state used only by `isVisible`/`isEnabled`/`when` predicates — modules never act
through it).

Types that belong to a single subsystem live next to their owner:

- `MutkaModule`, `MutkaAction`, `MutkaOpenHandler`, `MutkaSidebarPanel`,
  `ModulePermission`, `ContextMenuCategories` → `module-registry/module-registry.types.ts`
- `ThemePreference` → `theme-manager/theme-manager.types.ts`
- `TabBarTab`, `TabsSnapshot` → `tab-manager/tab-manager.types.ts`

**Critical invariant:** `FileItem` must exactly mirror the Rust struct in
`src-tauri/src/lib.rs` with `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`. Change one, change the other.

---

### `module-registry/` — The Hub

`ModuleRegistry.ts` is a singleton that stores what modules contribute and dispatches to
them. Modules act through their OWN `host`, not through an injected context — the registry
only stores actions/handlers and reads app state for visibility checks.

Public API:

```ts
ModuleRegistry.init(): void                         // wire the "action:dispatch" bus listener once
ModuleRegistry.register(module: MutkaModule): void
ModuleRegistry.unregister(moduleId: string): void
ModuleRegistry.executeAction(actionId: string): Promise<void>
ModuleRegistry.resolveOpen(item: FileItem): Promise<void>
ModuleRegistry.getContextMenuActions(context: BaseContext, zone: MenuZone): ContextMenuGroup[]
ModuleRegistry.getSidebarPanels(): MutkaSidebarPanel[]
```

- `init()` runs once from `App.tsx`; it subscribes to the `"action:dispatch"` EventBus
  event so a shortcut or menu click resolves to `executeAction(actionId)`.
- `executeAction` / `resolveOpen` are async and catch all errors per-module. On throw they
  log and emit `"error:action"` — never crash the app. They take NO context argument; the
  registry reads current state itself (via `SelectionStore`, `ClipboardStore`, `AppBridge`).
- `getContextMenuActions` filters by the clicked `zone` (an action's
  `contextMenuZones`, default file rows + empty background — see `menu/menuZone.ts`) and by
  each action's `isVisible`, then groups by `contextMenuCategory` into `ContextMenuGroup[]`.
  Right-clicks in an editable field resolve to `"editable"` and show the native menu instead.

`module-registry.types.ts` is the INTERNAL registry contract (`MutkaModule`,
`MutkaAction`, `MutkaOpenHandler`, `MutkaSidebarPanel`, `ModulePermission`,
`ContextMenuCategories`). Authors do NOT write these — they write `defineModule(...)` and
`sandbox/proxyModule.ts` converts a manifest into a `MutkaModule` the registry stores.

Modules are auto-discovered by `src/moduleLoader.ts`; they are never registered by hand in
`App.tsx`. Built-in open handlers register at priority 0 first, so community modules can
override with a higher priority.

**Do NOT** add business logic here. The registry dispatches; modules execute.
There is no `connect()`, `buildContext()`, `tracePermissions()`, `getToolbarActions()`,
or `getModules()` — those were removed.

---

### `sandbox/` — The Module Runtime

The module execution + permission layer. Files:

| File                | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `defineModule.ts`   | Author-facing helper. Types only — returns its argument unchanged.                                                                                                                         |
| `hostProxy.ts`      | Builds the `host` object (`fs`, `board`, `nav`, `tabs`, `dialog`, `ui`, `statusbar`, `net`, `sys`, `refresh`, `onCommand`, `onOpen`, `onColumn`, `onUIEvent`, `events.on`, `log`). All methods async. |
| `capabilities.ts`   | THE gateway vocabulary. Maps each capability to its required permission and the operation that fulfils it. The ONLY file that calls `invoke` / `AppBridge` / `TabManager`.                 |
| `gateway.ts`        | The permission barrier. Checks the manifest declared the required permission, then runs the capability. No declaration → throws.                                                           |
| `LocalHost.ts`      | In-process runtime for built-ins.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `SandboxHost.ts`    | Web-Worker runtime for community modules.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `sandbox.worker.ts` | The worker entry that loads untrusted source and proxies host-calls.                                                                                                                       |
| `protocol.ts`       | The only shapes allowed to cross the host↔worker boundary (structured-clone safe): `SandboxCommand`, `SandboxOpenHandler`, `WhenClause`, `SandboxManifest`, `HostSnapshot`, wire messages. |
| `proxyModule.ts`    | Turns a manifest into a `MutkaModule` and registers it.                                                                                                                                    |
| `whenClause.ts`     | Evaluates a declarative `when` clause against `BaseContext` (host-side).                                                                                                                   |
| `eventWhitelist.ts` | The set of events a module may subscribe to via `host.events.on`.                                                                                                                          |

Permissions: `fs:read`, `fs:write`, `fs:temp`, `clipboard:read`, `clipboard:write`,
`navigation`, `view`, `dialog`, `network`, `storage`, `secrets`, `ui`, `shell`. A
module must declare every one it uses. `ui` gates declarative UI surfaces (`ui.*`) and
status-bar items (`statusbar.*`). There is no SQLite/`db` capability — a module reads a
`.sqlite` file's bytes via `fs:read` and decodes the format itself in its worker.
`fs:temp` (writing a short-lived file to the OS temp dir) is a
deliberately weaker sibling of `fs:write` — e.g. `core.drop-import` needs it to stage
Finder drops before copying them in.

Why `when` is data, not a function: a worker module can't hand a predicate across
postMessage, so visibility is described declaratively (`selection`, `clipboard`) and
evaluated host-side via `whenClause.ts`.

---

### `app-bridge/AppBridge.ts` — React State Bridge

A handful of privileged operations live in `App.tsx` React state: navigation history, the
modal dialog, and directory refresh. `App.tsx` connects a provider once via
`AppBridge.connect(...)`; the `nav`, `dialog`, and `app.refresh` capabilities read through
it. This is what lets those capabilities exist without core knowing about React.

---

### `event-bus/` — Loose Coupling

`EventBus.ts` is a typed publish/subscribe bus; `events.ts` defines the `EventMap` (every
event → payload type) and the `Events` name constants. Use it when two parts need to react
to each other **without importing each other**.

```typescript
EventBus.emit(Events.Clipboard.changed, state);
const unsub = EventBus.on(Events.Clipboard.changed, (s) => { ... });
unsub();
```

Use `Events.Namespace.name` constants, not bare strings. Community modules add custom
events via declaration merging on `EventMap` (see the comment in `events.ts`).

**Do NOT** use the EventBus for data a component renders — pass that via props/state.

#### Known events (keep this in sync with `events.ts`)

| Event                                       | Payload                    | Notes                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `app:ready`                                 | `undefined`                | launch hook; bridge ready (subscribable)         |
| `theme:changed`                             | `{ preference; resolved }` | from `ThemeManager`                              |
| `home:changed`                              | `{ homeDir }`              | from `HomeStore` (home dir resolved/overridden)  |
| `settings:changed`                          | `{ open }`                 | from `SettingsStore` (overlay opened/closed)     |
| `file:external-drop`                        | `{ files; dest }`          | Finder drop → `core.drop-import` (subscribable)  |
| `clipboard:changed`                         | `ClipboardState`           | from `ClipboardStore` / clipboard module         |
| `navigation:back` / `navigation:forward`    | `undefined`                | toolbar flash animation                          |
| `file:modifier-open`                        | `{ item; modifiers }`      | ctrl/⌘-open of an item (subscribable by modules) |
| `module:registered` / `module:unregistered` | `{ moduleId }`             | sidebar-panel refresh                            |
| `error:action`                              | `{ actionId; error }`      | failed action                                    |
| `input:mouse-navigate`                      | `{ direction }`            | mouse back/forward (subscribable by modules)     |
| `tabs:changed`                              | `TabsSnapshot`             | any tab-state mutation                           |
| `tabs:last-closed`                          | `{ path }`                 | last tab closed → global nav resumes             |
| `action:dispatch`                           | `{ actionId }`             | a shortcut/menu requests an action run           |
| `selection:changed`                         | `{ items }`                | from `SelectionStore`                            |
| `ui:changed`                                | `{ moduleId; surfaceId }`  | a module's declarative UI surface/modal changed  |
| `statusbar:changed`                         | `undefined`                | a module status-bar item changed                 |
| `directory:changed`                         | `{ path }`                 | current dir changed on disk (subscribable, debounced) |

Of these, modules may subscribe ONLY to the whitelisted set in
`sandbox/eventWhitelist.ts` (currently `app:ready`, `input:mouse-navigate`,
`selection:changed`, `file:modifier-open`, `file:middle-open`, `file:open-no-app`,
`file:external-drop`, `sidebar:item-remove`, `directory:changed`).
`ui:changed` / `statusbar:changed` are host-internal (React mirrors them) and not subscribable.

---

### `shortcut-manager/ShortcutManager.ts` — Keyboard

Listens to `document keydown`, normalizes the combo, and emits `"action:dispatch"` on the
EventBus when a registered shortcut fires. `ModuleRegistry` (wired in `init()`) runs the
matching action.

Shortcut format (normalized): `"meta+c"`, `"meta+shift+n"`, `"f2"`, `"meta+backspace"`.
Parts: `meta`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `shift`, then the key name (lowercase).

**Conflict rule**: last registration wins, with a `console.warn`. Document your shortcuts.

---

### `input-manager/InputManager.ts` — Low-level Input Capture

Captures raw platform input and translates it to semantic EventBus events. Modules
subscribe to those events instead of touching `document.addEventListener`.

```typescript
InputManager.init()    // once at app startup (module scope in App.tsx)
InputManager.dispose()
```

Emits `"input:mouse-navigate"` (`{ direction: "back" | "forward" }`) from either the Tauri
NSEvent monitor (driver-managed mice) or a DOM `mousedown` with `button === 3`/`4` (raw HID
mice). Modules never need to know which path fired.

**Rules:** never dispatch actions directly; never call `invoke()` for feature logic; may use
`listen()` for platform-level subscriptions.

---

### `tab-manager/TabManager.ts` — Tabs (single source of truth)

Owns all tab state AND the current directory when a tab is active. Drives the `TabBar`
component via the `"tabs:changed"` event. Modules reach it ONLY through the `tabs`
capability (`openTab`, `openTabInBackground`, `isActive`); the `nav` capability's
navigate/back/forward also resolve against the active tab. Emits `"tabs:changed"`,
`"tabs:last-closed"`, and `"navigation:back"/"forward"`.

---

### `stores/` — Plain State Singletons

Authoritative, framework-agnostic state owners. Each holds one slice of app state and
emits a typed event when it changes; React mirrors them into local state for rendering,
and modules drive them through capabilities (never by importing the store):

- `SelectionStore.ts` — current selection, emits `"selection:changed"`.
- `ClipboardStore.ts` — current clipboard, emits `"clipboard:changed"`.
- `ListingStore.ts` — visible items + active sort, emits `"listing:changed"`.
- `ViewStore.ts` — view preferences (e.g. show-hidden), emits `"view:changed"`.
- `HomeStore.ts` — the app home directory, emits `"home:changed"`. Set at launch by
  `core.home` via the `home` capability; any module may override it.
- `SettingsStore.ts` — whether the settings overlay is open, emits `"settings:changed"`.
  Flipped by `core.settings` (⌘,) via the `settings` capability.
- `UIStore.ts` — each module's declarative `UINode` surfaces + the active modal, emits
  `"ui:changed"`. Written by the `ui` capability; read by `components/Declarative/`.
- `StatusBarStore.ts` — bottom status-bar items per module, emits `"statusbar:changed"`.
  Written by the `statusbar` capability; read by `components/StatusBar/`.

`SelectionStore` + `ClipboardStore` are also the read source the registry uses to build a
`BaseContext` for visibility checks.

---

### `theme-manager/ThemeManager.ts` — Dark / Light

Reads the preference from `localStorage` `"mutka.theme"` (falls back to `"system"`),
applies `data-theme` on `<html>`, and emits `"theme:changed"` when it resolves.

```typescript
ThemeManager.get(): ThemePreference
ThemeManager.set(pref: ThemePreference): void
ThemeManager.getResolved(): "dark" | "light"
```

`"system"` follows `window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)")` and updates live.

---

## Rules for this folder

1. **No React imports** — core is framework-agnostic infrastructure.
2. **No `invoke()` calls — ONE exception:** `sandbox/capabilities.ts` is the single system
   gateway and intentionally calls `invoke`. No other core file may.
3. **No imports from `src/sandbox-builtins/` or `src/components/`**.
4. **Singletons** — `ModuleRegistry`, `EventBus`, `ShortcutManager`, `InputManager`,
   `ThemeManager`, `TabManager`, `AppBridge`, and the stores are each instantiated once and
   exported as a named const.

---

## Adding to the core

Adding a new core file requires answering YES to ALL:

- [ ] Is it shared infrastructure used by multiple modules or components?
- [ ] Does it have zero feature logic (no specific FS behavior, no UI rendering)?
- [ ] Can it be reasoned about without knowing any specific module?

To expose a NEW system operation to modules, do NOT add it ad hoc: add a Rust command in
`lib.rs`, then a capability entry in `sandbox/capabilities.ts` mapped to its permission.
If a capability isn't listed there, it does not exist for any module.
